# Why this exists: macOS attaches a granted permission — microphone, speech recognition,
# Automation — to the app's signing identity. An ad-hoc signature (`codesign --sign -`) has no
# identity; its fingerprint is a hash of the binary, so every rebuild looks like a brand new
# app and every permission is asked for again. A certificate is a stable identity, so a rebuild
# keeps what you already granted.
#
# Run once. `build.sh` picks the certificate up automatically from then on, and falls back to
# ad-hoc signing if it isn't there.
